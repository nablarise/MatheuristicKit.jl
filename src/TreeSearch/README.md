# TreeSearch

A flexible and extensible tree search framework for Julia, part of the NablaMatheuristicKit package. This module provides implementations of common tree search algorithms for solving combinatorial optimization problems.

## Overview

TreeSearch implements a generic interface for tree search algorithms, allowing users to use pre-implemented search strategies (DFS, BFS, Best-First, Beam Search, Limited Discrepancy Search) and implement custom search strategies.


## Implemented Search Strategies

- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Best-First Search
- Beam Search
- Limited Discrepancy Search (LDS)
